The repo contains the code for Python implementation of Classification of ECG signals based on Cyclic spectrum.
The models folder contains the implementation for ML and DL models.
ECG.zip contains the standalone version of the Matlab code to compute the cyclic autocorrelation of the underlying cyclostationary signal and
the Fourier coefficients of its additive periodic component. This version, that immediately
allows one to produce plots of the quantities of interest, must be inserted in a for loop in order to create the whole data base.
